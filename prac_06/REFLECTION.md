# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I used to complete projects in one session, but now I split them into parts and test each section separately.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I need to treat practical tasks as skill-building opportunities, not just assignments to finish.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I start tasks with a clear mind and refine them later, which I plan to keep doing.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I should avoid using unclear names in my work.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

Iâ€™d like more detailed feedback and clearer instructions for assignments and practicals.
